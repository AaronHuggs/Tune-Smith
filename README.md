# TuneSmith

This project was created as part of Codecademy's Web Development course. It uses React and the Spotify API.

## What does it do?

TuneSmith allows users to create a playlist with their favorite songs and save the playlist to their Spotify account.

## Can't I just do that on Spotify?

TuneSmith's interface is much snappier than Spotify, as it only has to pull search results from Spotify, rather than scrape your data and sell it to advertisers.

## Future Features

• Preview samples for each track.  
• Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results.  
• Support for Youtube Music.
